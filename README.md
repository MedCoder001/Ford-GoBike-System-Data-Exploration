# Ford GoBike System Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the Ford GoBike System dataset to gain insights into bike-sharing patterns and user behaviors in the greater San Francisco Bay area. The analysis is divided into two parts:

1. **Part 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
2. **Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

## Part 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

In this part, the dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accurate and reliable analysis in subsequent stages. The following steps are performed:

- Importing necessary libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- Loading the raw dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and features.
- Handling missing values and inconsistencies in the data.
- Cleaning and formatting the dataset for further analysis.
- Saving the cleaned dataset for use in Part 2.

## Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Part 2 focuses on exploring the cleaned dataset and extracting meaningful insights from it. The analysis includes the following key aspects:

- Investigation Overview: A brief overview of the objectives and scope of the analysis.
- Dataset Overview and Executive Summary: Summary statistics and insights derived from the cleaned dataset.
- Frequency of Rides by Days: Visualizations depicting the distribution of trip records by days of the week.
- Frequency of Rides by Hours: Analysis of ride frequency per hour to identify peak usage times.
- Frequency of Rides by User Age: Visualization of ride frequency distribution by user age to understand user demographics.
- Frequency of Rides by User Type: Analysis of ride frequency based on user type (subscribers vs. customers).
- Trip Duration across Gender, User Type, and User Age: Scatterplots illustrating the relationship between ride duration, user age, gender, and user type.
- Trip Duration across Gender, User Age, and Bike Sharing Status: Further exploration of ride duration considering bike sharing status in addition to gender and user age.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides valuable insights into bike-sharing patterns and user behaviors in San Francisco. Key findings include the influence of user type on ride behavior, the limited impact of gender on ride duration, and the significance of bike-sharing behavior in determining ride durations. The analysis sheds light on factors influencing ride durations and user preferences, contributing to a better understanding of bike-sharing systems in urban areas.
